Netflix plans real-life Squid Game reality TV show,"June 15, 2022","Netflix is recruiting participants for a reality TV show inspired by its most popular series of all time, Squid Game.
However, it will not be life or death that is at stake, as depicted in the South Korean dystopian drama.
Instead, 456 recruits from around the world will play games where “the worst fate is going home empty-handed” – missing out on a $4.56m (£3.8m) prize.
Netflix also confirmed that the popular series would be renewed for a second season earlier this week.
On Wednesday, the platform announced that its new 10-episode series – Squid Game: The Challenge – would offer the “largest cast and lump cash prize in reality TV show history”.
“As [players] compete through a series of games inspired by the original show – plus surprising new additions – their strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated around them,” it added.
Participants need to be at least 21 years old. They must speak English, and be available for up to 4 weeks in early 2023 for filming.
The 456 participants are a nod to the fictional series, which features the same number of players, with its main protagonist Seong Gi-hun also referred to as Player 456.
The South Korean thriller series tells the story of debt-ridden people competing for a huge cash prize in a deadly series of children’s games.
It holds the record as Netflix’s most-popular series of all time, and it was streamed by 111 million users in its first 28 days of its launch.
Director, writer and executive producer of Squid Game Hwang Dong-hyuk said in a statement on Monday: “It took 12 years to bring the first season of Squid Game to life last year. But it took 12 days for Squid Game to become the most popular Netflix series ever.”

Spider-Man: No Way Home becomes the first top pandemic-era film,"December 28, 2021","The latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise has become the first pandemic-era movie to make more than $1bn (£750m) at the global box office.
Spider-Man: No Way Home also took the title of the highest-grossing film of 2021, the first pandemic-era hit movie.
It beat out the Chinese-made Korean War epic The Battle of Lake Changjin, which has grossed more than $905m worldwide.
The last movie to gross more than $1bn was 2019’s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, according to media data analytics firm Comscore.
No other Hollywood production has come near to reaching that box office milestone since the pandemic began two years ago.
Over the weekend, global box office takings for the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe film reached $1.05bn.
The co-production between Sony and Disney hit its milestone less than two weeks after its premiere even as the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has spread rapidly around the world, raising fresh concerns about indoor events.
The film has not been released in China, which is currently the world’s biggest cinema market.
Spider-Man: No Way Home sees Tom Holland return as the third iteration of Peter Parker alongside Zendaya’s MJ and Benedict Cumberbatch as the sorcerer Doctor Strange.
The franchise’s 2019 offering Spider-Man: Far From Home was the first Spider-Man film to break the $1bn mark at the box office and is currently the highest-grossing movie in the franchise with $1.132bn in global ticket sales, according to Comscore.
The latest film follows on from Far From Home, in which the villainous Mysterio unmasked Parker before dying.
The series is a collaboration between Disney’s Marvel Studios and Sony.
In 2015, Disney, Marvel Studios, and Sony agreed to share the film rights for Spider-Man, which led to a new iteration of the character being introduced and integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Before No Way Home, MGM’s latest James Bond movie No Time to Die, which made $774m at the box office globally, was the highest-grossing Hollywood film of both 2021 and the pandemic.

"Maki Kaji, “Godfather of Sudoku”, dies at 69","August 18, 2021","Maki Kaji, the Japanese man known as the “Godfather of Sudoku”, has died at the age of 69.
Kaji gave the number puzzle its name after publishing it in his magazine Nikoli in the 1980s.
Since then the popular game – involving placing the numbers 1 to 9 in each row, column and square of a 9 by 9 grid – has spread around the globe.
Tournaments take place across the world and it is estimated that millions play versions of the game each day.
On Monday Nikoli published a statement on its website saying Kaji had died at his home in Tokyo from bile duct cancer on 10 August 2021.
Kaji was born in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo in 1951.
After dropping out of Keio University, he set up the puzzle magazine Nikoli, which published its first edition in August 1980.
The origins of Sudoku are unclear. Some credit the 18th Century Swiss mathematician Euler as its creator, while others say it came to the Arab world from China via India in the 8th or 9th Century, according to the New York Times.
French newspapers published a number of early versions of the game in the late 19th Century, including one called “le carré magique diabolique”, or the evil magic square, published by La France newspaper in July 1895.
But US architect Howard Garns is often credited as the creator of the modern version of the puzzle in the 1970s, under the name Number Place. It was this game that Kaji spotted in 1984.
“It was a very interesting puzzle, fun to solve,” he said in a 2008 speech.
“But the name, Number Place, did not hit me. I wanted to create a Japanese name.”
Kaji landed on Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru, meaning “Numbers should be single”.
Pushed by colleagues to come up with a catchier name as he rushed to get to a horse race, he said he came up with the name Sudoku “in about 25 seconds”.
The game became popular in Japan but only turned into a global phenomenon in 2004, after The Times of London published a puzzle.
Kaji did not trademark the game, and did not gain financially from its huge success. But he said the joy of the puzzle and of others enjoying the game was more important than any monetary reward.
“I get really moved when I see a new idea for a puzzle which has lots of potential,” he told the BBC in 2007.
“I get really excited about it. It is like finding treasure.”

TikTok tests disappearing video stories feature,"August 5, 2021","Video-sharing platform TikTok is trialing a new vanishing video stories feature similar to functions on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram.
TikTok Stories will allow users to see content posted by accounts they follow for 24 hours before they are deleted.
It comes as WhatsApp rolls out a feature for users to post photos or videos that vanish after they are seen.
This week rival social media platform Twitter shut down its Fleets disappearing stories feature.
TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told the BBC: “We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience.”
“Currently we’re experimenting with ways to give creators additional formats to bring their creative ideas to life for the TikTok community,” the spokesperson added.
The feature was highlighted by social media consultant Matt Navarra, who shared screenshots of TikTok Stories on Twitter.
TikTok is the latest major social media platform to experiment with the feature first made popular by Snapchat.
The news comes as Facebook-owned WhatsApp rolls out a function that allows its users to have photos or videos vanish after they are seen.
In the “view once” feature, an image is deleted after the recipient opens it for the first time and doesn’t save to a phone.
WhatsApp said the feature was aimed at “giving users even more control over their privacy”.
However, child protection advocates have expressed concerns that automatically vanishing messages could help cover up evidence of child sexual abuse.
On 3 August, Twitter discontinued its Fleets function which allowed users to post photos and videos that disappeared after 24 hours.
Fleets was first announced in March last year in response to the popularity of Snapchat and Instagram Stories.
In the eight months that Fleets was available, Twitter added a number of new features, including GIFs, stickers and different coloured text.
However, the feature did not become as widely used as the company had hoped.

Chinese-Canadian pop star detained on suspicion of rape,"August 1, 2021","Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu has been detained by Beijing police on suspicion of rape, police announced Saturday, following an accusation the former member of the Korean boy band EXO lured young women into sexual relationships.
Wu, 30, earlier was accused by a teenager of having sex with her while she was drunk. Wu denied the accusation.
The teenager said seven other women contacted her to say Wu seduced them with promises of jobs and other opportunities. She said some were under 18 but gave no indication whether they were younger than China’s age of consent of 14.
Wu has been “criminally detained” on suspicion of rape “in response to relevant information reported on the internet” including that he “repeatedly lured young women to have sexual relations,” the police statement said. It gave no other details.
The pop star had previously denied the accusations. “There was no ‘groupie sex’! There was no ‘underage’!” Wu wrote last month on his social media account. “If there were this kind of thing, please everyone relax, I would put myself in jail!”
The news was trending as the no. 1 most searched topic on Weibo on Saturday night, and some users online started commenting on Wu’s social media account, telling him to “Get out of China!”
Wu is a Canadian citizen, according to the police statement.
The official paper of the Communist Party, the People’s Daily, weighed in on the case, saying in a short opinion post online that “Having a foreign nationality is not a protective talisman, and no matter how big the name is, there is no immunity.”
The teenager publicized her accusations on social media and later in an interview with the internet portal NetEase. A day after that interview appeared, at least 10 brands including Porsche and Louis Vuitton broke off endorsement and other deals with Wu.
According to the interview, she thought she was meeting Wu for a career opportunity. Instead, his staff who was present forced her to drink. As someone who did not go to bars, she said her tolerance was low and she was drunk after two drinks. The next day, she woke up in Wu’s bed. That morning, he was kind to her and promised to take care of her, she said.
The teenager said that was the beginning of what she had thought was their relationship. This was the case until March, when he stopped returning her messages.
At first, she said she felt sorry for herself. But after she learned that there were other women who had been treated similarly, she said she felt there were others who were worse off.
“I don’t believe this is just my own personal matter. You can even say that this is a problem with the atmosphere in China’s entertainment circle,” she said in the NetEase interview.
Wu said that he had met the young woman on Dec. 5, 2020, but “I didn’t force her to drink,” and “there was not this sort of ‘details’ she describes.”
“I didn’t expect my silence to encourage these rumors, and I couldn’t stand it!” Wu previously wrote. “There were a lot of people there that day who can bear witness.”

Bearded bassist Dusty Hill dies in his sleep at 72,"July 29, 2021","ZZ Top’s Dusty Hill, the long-bearded bassist for the million-selling Texas blues-rock trio known for such hits as “Legs” and “Gimme All Your Lovin’,” has died at age 72.
In a Facebook post-Wednesday, guitarist Billy Gibbons and drummer Frank Beard said Hill died in his sleep. They didn’t give a cause of death, but a July 21 post on the band’s website said Hill was “on a short detour back to Texas, to address a hip issue.” At that time, the band said that its longtime guitar tech, Elwood Francis, would fill in on bass, slide guitar and harmonica.
Born Joe Michael Hill in Dallas, he, Gibbons and Beard formed ZZ Top in Houston in 1969, naming themselves in part after blues singer Z.Z. Hill and influenced by the British power trio Cream. Their debut release, “ZZ Top’s First Album,” came out in 1970. Three years later, they broke through commercially with “La Grange,” a funky blues song in the style of Slim Harpo’s ”Shake Your Hips” that paid tribute to the Chicken Ranch, a notorious brothel outside of the Texas town of La Grange.
The band went on to have such hits as “Tush” in 1975, and the 1980s songs “Sharp Dressed Man,” ”Legs,” “Gimme All Your Lovin’” and “Sleeping Bag.” The band’s 1976 “Worldwide Texas Tour,” with its iconic Texas-shaped stage festooned with cactuses, snakes and longhorn cattle, was one of the decade’s most successful rock tours. Their million-selling albums included ”Eliminator,” “Afterburner” and “Antenna.”
ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, introduced by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards.
“These cats are steeped in the blues, so am I,” Richards said. “These cats know their blues and they know how to dress it up. When I first saw them, I thought, ‘I hope these guys are not on the run, because that disguise is not going to work.’”
That look, with all three members wearing dark sunglasses and Gibbons and Hill sporting long, wispy beards, became so familiar, in part thanks to their MTV videos in the 1980s, that it was the subject of a New Yorker cartoon and a joke on “The Simpsons.”

Bayreuth opera festival returns after a one-year break,"July 26, 2021","The annual Bayreuth opera festival has returned after a one-year break forced by the coronavirus pandemic, with a woman conducting for the first time in the 145-year history of the event.
Oksana Lyniv won enthusiastic applause after conducting Richard Wagner’s “Flying Dutchman” at Bayreuth’s Festspielhaus on Sunday, news agency dpa reported.
Lyniv, a 43-year-old native of Ukraine, is the former principal conductor of Austria’s Graz Opera and a former assistant to current Berlin Philharmonic chief conductor Kirill Petrenko at the Bavarian State Opera.
The opening performance of Bayreuth opera festival was attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her husband, who have been regular guests at the annual celebration of Wagner’s work over the years. Asked at a reception later Sunday about the first woman conducting, Merkel replied: “Finally!”
Festival director Katharina Wagner said that there weren’t that many female conductors in the past, and that it takes courage to learn to conduct. A generation has now grown up “that is courageous enough,” she said.
Although coronavirus infection rates are currently low in Germany, the festival is going ahead with restrictions. This year, 911 attendees per performance are allowed, compared with nearly 2,000 in a normal year. Only people who are vaccinated, have recovered from the virus or have a negative test are allowed in.
The festival continues until Aug. 25.

"Jackie Mason, a rabbi-turned-comedian, dies at 93","July 26, 2021","Jackie Mason, a rabbi-turned-comedian whose feisty brand of standup comedy led him to Catskills nightclubs, West Coast talk shows and Broadway stages, has died. He was 93.
Mason died Saturday at 6 p.m. ET at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after being hospitalized for over two weeks, the celebrity lawyer Raoul Felder told The Associated Press.
The irascible Mason was known for his sharp wit and piercing social commentary, often about being Jewish, men and women and his own inadequacies. His typical style was amused outrage.
“Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe,” he once joked. Another Mason line was: “Politics doesn’t make strange bedfellows, marriage does.” About himself, he once said: “I was so self-conscious, every time football players went into a huddle; I thought they were talking about me.”
His death was mourned far and wide, from fellow comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who called him “one of the best,” to Fox News Channel personality Sean Hannity, who hailed Mason as “irreverent, iconoclastic, funny, smart and a great American patriot.” Henry Winkler tweeted: “Now you get to make heaven laugh.”
Mason was born Jacob Maza, the son of a rabbi. His three brothers became rabbis. So did Mason, who at one time had congregations in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Comedy eventually proved to be a more persistent calling than God.
“A person has to feel emotionally barren or empty or frustrated in order to become a comedian,” he told The Associated Press in 1987. “I don’t think people who feel comfortable or happy are motivated to become comedians. You’re searching for something and you’re willing to pay a high price to get that attention.”
Mason started in show business as a social director at a resort in the Catskills. He was the guy who got everybody up to play Simon Says, quiz games or shuffleboard. He told jokes, too. After one season, he was playing clubs throughout the Catskills for better money.
“Nobody else knew me, but in the mountains, I was a hit,” Mason recalled.
In 1961, the pint-sized comic got a big break, an appearance on Steve Allen’s weekly television variety show. His success brought him to “The Ed Sullivan Show” and other programs.
He was banned for two years from the “Sullivan” show when he allegedly gave the host the finger when Sullivan signaled to him to wrap up his act during an appearance on Oct. 18, 1964.
Mason’s act even carried him to Broadway, where he put on several one-man shows, including “Freshly Squeezed” in 2005, “Love Thy Neighbor” in 1996 and “The World According to Me” in 1988, for which he received a special Tony Award.
“I feel like Ronald Reagan tonight,” Mason joked on Tony night. “He was an actor all his life, knew nothing about politics and became president of the United States. I’m an ex-rabbi who knew nothing about acting and I’m getting a Tony Award.”

Giant screen topples before Rolling Loud music festival,"July 23, 2021","A giant video screen collapsed Thursday at a South Florida stadium, a day before the Rolling Loud hip-hop music festival was set to begin. There were no injuries.
Organizers posted on Twitter that the giant screen toppled over onto one of the festival’s stages at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, but it was expected to be repaired before doors opened Friday.
“Nobody was hurt and it will be fixed before doors open tomorrow. The show goes on!” the tweet said.
Helicopter news footage shows a large pile of downed scaffolding and other equipment next to one of the stages.
Like many other events, Rolling Loud was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Originally set for May 2020, the event was rescheduled several times. This weekend’s lineup includes A$AP Rocky, Travis Scott and Post Malone.

"Kanye West unveils new album, Jay-Z track at listening event","July 23, 2021","Kanye West barely said a word during his album listening session Thursday night, but the mercurial rapper still had most attendees standing on their feet while hanging on every word of his new project.
West unveiled his 10th studio album, “Donda” in front of a packed crowd at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. His album was named after his mother, Donda West, who died at the age of 58 following plastic surgery complications in 2007.
Pulling off the listening session — which was live-streamed on Apple Music — was an impressive feat for West, who sold out the venue after he announced two days ago that the first public listen of his highly-anticipated album would take place. Some of the big names who attended the event were Rick Ross, Khloe Kardashian and his estranged wife Kim Kardashian West, who showed up in a red jumpsuit with their kids.
Unlike West’s typical high-energy concerts, he appeared more mellow. He let his music do the talking while most attendees listened in silence and applauded at the end of each track of his album, slated for release Friday, that features gospel themes, hip-hop vibes, his Auto-Tune vocals, a track featuring his friend-mentor Jay-Z and recorded speeches made by his mother.
While sporting an all-red outfit with orange shoes, West sometimes walked, fell to his knees, and pranced around on a white flooring about the size of the football field, where the city’s professional football and soccer teams play home games.
The 22-time Grammy winner revealed in a commercial, featuring U.S. track star Sha’Carri Richardson, during the NBA Finals on Tuesday that his album will be released Friday. The commercial, scored and directed by West, featured “No Child Left Behind,” a song from the album.
When West began playing “No Child Left Behind,” he drop to one knee before he slightly lifted up into a track runner’s stance like Richardson, who will miss the Tokyo Olympics after a positive marijuana test this month. The rapper then stood up and pointed his finger into the air as the words “he’s done miracles on me” were heard on the song.
The crowd appeared surprise to hear when Jay-Z began rapping on the final song of the listening session. On social media, the song was lauded for Jay-Z’s verse that included “This might be the return of the throne,” a nod toward the tandem’s 2011 album “Watch the Throne,” which earned a Grammy nomination.
After the song finished, West made his way toward the end zone area, stared at the crowd for a few moments and calmly walked off the floor as the audience collectively cheered for him.
West, 44, is mostly known as being associated with Chicago, but he was born in Atlanta — a Georgia city where there are no restrictions against large gatherings. He gifted 5,000 tickets to faculty, staff and students from some Atlanta HBCUs including Clark Atlanta, Morehouse, Spelman, Morris Brown and the Interdenominational Theological Center.
West’s new project is a follow up to his 2019 gospel-themed album “Jesus is King,” which won a Grammy for best contemporary Christian album.
Last year, West announced on Twitter — with colorful cover art and a track list — that he would release his latest album. At the time, his tweets indicated that his project would release on the same day as his rival Taylor Swift’s project “Folklore,” but his album ended up being postponed.
The two music stars have been in an ongoing beef since West famously interrupted Swift’s speech during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when she won for best female video. It appeared both put their differences aside after she introduced him when he won the video vanguard award at the 2015 VMAs, but a leaked video clip between both about his controversial song “Famous” caused more drama.
It’s not the first time Kanye has hosted a listening event for an upcoming album. In 2016, he debuted his album “The Life of Pablo” during a massive event and fashion show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Several big names who attended the show included Kardashian West, 50 Cent, Lil Kim, Caitlyn Jenner, A$AP Rocky and 2 Chainz.

Obama-Springsteen book ‘Renegades’ to be published in October,"July 22, 2021","There’s a new chapter in the friendship between Barack and the Boss.
“Renegades: Born in the USA” is a bound edition of the popular “Renegades” podcast featuring conversations on everything from fame to cars to the country itself between former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen. Penguin Random House and Obama’s Higher Ground company announced Thursday that “Renegades” will come out October 26. The $50 book will include rare photographs, handwritten Springsteen lyrics and annotated Obama speeches.
“Over the years, what we’ve found is that we’ve got a shared sensibility,” Obama said in a statement. “About work, about family, and about America. In our own ways, Bruce and I have been on parallel journeys trying to understand this country that’s given us both so much. Trying to chronicle the stories of its people. Looking for a way to connect our own individual searches for meaning and truth and community with the larger story of America.”
In an introduction for the book, Springsteen wrote that he and Obama had raised serious issues about the “fate of the country, the fortune of its citizens, and the destructive, ugly, corrupt forces at play that would like to take it all down.”
“This is a time for serious consideration of who we want to be and what kind of country we will leave our children,” wrote Springsteen, who in 2016 received a Medal of Freedom from Obama. “Will we let slip through our hands the best of us or will we turn united to face the fire? Within this book you won’t find the answers to those questions, but you will find a couple of seekers doing their best to get us to ask better questions.”

Harvey Weinstein to face further rape charges in California,"July 21, 2021","New York prison officials handed convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein over to California on Tuesday to face additional sexual assault charges, ending the former movie mogul’s lengthy fight to delay his extradition.
Weinstein, 69, was booked into a downtown Los Angeles jail Tuesday afternoon, records showed. He could be arraigned on 11 sexual assault counts, including four counts of rape, as early as Wednesday morning, according to his LA attorney, Mark Werksman. The district attorney’s office had no immediate comment.
Weinstein’s lawyers had been trying to negotiate to stop the transfer, but it had been expected to happen soon, his spokesperson Juda Engelmayer said.
“We will be fighting so that Harvey can receive his needed medical care and of course, so that he can be treated fairly,” Engelmayer said. “Due process, the presumption of innocence and a fair trial are all still his right.”
A New York judge in June approved Weinstein’s extradition to California, denying his lawyers’ request to keep him at a state prison near Buffalo, where he is serving a 23-year sentence for a rape conviction last year, until the start of jury selection in the Los Angeles case.
Weinstein’s lawyer, Norman Effman, argued he should remain in the New York facility’s hospital-like maximum-security setting while receiving treatment for health problems including a loss of eyesight.
Weinstein’s time in custody in California will count toward his New York sentence, officials said.
Weinstein was charged in January 2020 with 11 sexual assault counts in California involving five women, stemming from allegations in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills from 2004 to 2013. The charges include rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint and sexual penetration by use of force.
Weinstein maintains his innocence and contends that any sexual activity was consensual.
The California charges were announced shortly before Weinstein’s conviction in New York City on charges that he raped an aspiring actress in 2013 in a Manhattan hotel room and forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment.
He is appealing that conviction.
A lawyer for one of Weinstein’s accusers applauded Tuesday’s transfer, which was repeatedly delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as legal arguments over paperwork and his medical needs.
“The opportunity to hold Weinstein accountable for his actions in California gives voice to the survivors including my client, Jane Doe 4,” attorney Elizabeth Fegan said in a statement. “They deserve to be heard and to have Weinstein answer for his actions. Our hope is that a guilty verdict in California will ensure that Harvey Weinstein will spend the rest of his life behind bars – securing justice for women everywhere.”

Titane wins top Palme d’Or prize in Cannes Film Festival,"July 18, 2021","Titane – an outlandish film packed full of sex and violence – has won the top award at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.
Director Julie Ducournau is only the second woman to receive the Palme d’Or and the first female to win it alone.
The film, which is Ducournau’s second feature, tells the story of a young female killer who has sex with cars after surviving a childhood crash.
The award was prematurely revealed by US director Spike Lee at the beginning of Saturday’s ceremony.
The jury president let the big secret slip, before telling the audience: “I apologise for messing up.”
Ms Ducournau was still emotional when her film was officially announced as the winner, adding: “This evening has been perfect because it’s been imperfect.”
Titane had split critical opinion and has been described as one of the most shocking ever shown at the festival.
Cannes was the first full-scale film festival to take place since the start of the pandemic.
Last year’s event was canceled. The last film to take the Palme d’Or was Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite in 2019, which later swept the award circuit and won Best Picture at the 2020 Academy Awards.
A host of safety procedures were in place at the festival, including mask-wearing during screenings and frequent Covid saliva tests for attendees.
While the glitz and glamour was toned down this year, a raft of Hollywood stars – including Sharon Stone and Tilda Swinton – made appearances.
The second-most prestigious award of the festival, the Grand Prix, was a tie between Oscar-winning Iranian director Asghar Farhadi’s film A Hero and Compartment No 6 directed by Juho Kuosmanen.
Leos Carax won Best Director for musical Annette, which stars Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard.
Norwegian actress Renate Reinsve was named Best Actress for her part in The Worst Person In The World.

Jussie Smollett back in court relating to 2019 attack case,"July 16, 2021","US actor Jussie Smollett has returned to court, in the ongoing case relating to an incident that took place in 2019.
On 29 January 2019 the former Empire star told police he had been attacked in a racist and homophobic incident.
In February that year he was charged with filing a false police report, but the actor says he is innocent.
All charges against him were dropped in March, but a special prosecutor pursued the case.
Smollett was later charged with six counts of lying to police, to which he pleaded not guilty.
He previously maintained his innocence in September 2020.
Smollett appeared at the closed hearing to decide whether his lawyer should be disqualified from representing him in the ongoing trial, reports AP News.
It wasn’t related to any of the charges against him. Previous hearings in 2020 and 2021 have taken place online during coronavirus restrictions.
He is currently represented by lawyer Nenye Uche. Two men, Abel and Ola Osundairo, are who Chicago police have said Smollett paid to carry out the attack.
Smollett claims he was beaten, had an “unknown chemical substance” poured on him, was called racist and homophobic slurs and had a rope put around his neck in the attack.
The Osundairo brothers, who were set to testify against Smollett, claimed that Uche had spoken with them in 2019 about representing them.
Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt Rodriguez says that the brothers’ phone records from the time can’t be found.
Radio 1 Newsbeat has contacted Daniel Webb, the special prosecutor appointed for this case, for comment.
